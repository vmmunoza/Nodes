Some SC concepts:

1. **Upgradeability**: Smart contracts on the blockchain are immutable by design. However, developers have found ways to make contracts upgradable, meaning that the logic of the contract can be changed. This is often done through the use of proxy contracts.

2. **Storage Layouts and Memory**: Understanding how storage and memory work in Ethereum is crucial, especially when working with assembly language in Solidity or optimizing for gas usage.

3. **Reentrancy Attacks**: These attacks occur when external contract calls are allowed to make new calls to the calling contract before the initial call is finished. Understanding these can help in designing more secure contracts.

4. **Cross-Contract Execution**: Contracts can call functions in other contracts. Understanding the control flow, callback patterns, and possible security implications is important.

5. **Assembly Language in Solidity**: Solidity allows for inline assembly that gives developers fine control over the EVM at the expense of safety. Understanding this can lead to highly optimized code.

6. **Economic Attacks**: Smart contracts often interact with real-world value in the form of tokens. Developers need to consider possible economic incentives for attackers, including Miner Extractable Value (MEV) considerations.

7. **Metatransactions**: These are transactions where the gas cost is paid by a third party while retaining the original signer's information. They are useful for improving user experience.

8. **Gas Optimization**: Given the high cost of computation on the Ethereum network, writing contracts that minimize gas usage is an important skill.

9. **The Diamond Standard (EIP-2535)**: This standard provides a way to create upgradeable contracts with a standardized interface. 

10. **Optimistic and ZK Rollups**: These are Layer 2 solutions to improve scalability. Understanding how contracts need to be written for these systems is becoming increasingly important.

11. **Interoperability Standards**: Examples include cross-chain standards like IBC (Inter-Blockchain Communication), and bridging standards for connecting with other types of systems (like oracles or traditional databases).

12. **Creating and Interacting with DAPPs**: Understanding front-end JavaScript libraries like web3.js or ethers.js to interact with your contracts from a user interface.

13. **Contract Security and Auditing**: Writing secure smart contracts is hard, and learning how to do it well involves knowing about common pitfalls, attack vectors, and how to use automated analysis tools.

14. **Decentralized Storage Systems**: Integrating with decentralized file storage systems like IPFS or Filecoin can be a crucial part of a DApp architecture.

15. **Understanding EIPs (Ethereum Improvement Proposals)**: EIPs propose changes to the Ethereum protocol, and understanding relevant ones can be crucial for advanced contract development.
